## 🎬 PRESENTATION TIPS TO IMPRESS JUDGES

### **DO's** ✅
1. **Start with Impact, Not Features**
   - "Teachers save 98% of time" (not "Our database is MongoDB")
   
2. **Use Metrics**
   - "5,000 records in 5 minutes"
   - "1.5 million schools × $50,000/year"
   - Be specific, be impressive

3. **Show Don't Tell**
   - Live demo > PowerPoint
   - Real functionality > Mock-ups

4. **Speak to Business Value**
   - Don't say "We added a subject field"
   - Say "We give administrators subject-level visibility"
